    "\n",
    "In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. \n"

    "### Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "The whole point of a namespace tool like the class statement is to support name inheritance. In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute definition tree (one or more namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object.attr where object is an instance or class object, Python searches the namespace tree at and above object, for the first attr it can find. Because lower definitions in the tree override higher ones, inheritance forms the basis of specialization.\n",

Exactly like building a house, you use a blueprint to create a particular model, maybe a 3 bedroom detached dwelling. You would have a different blueprint for a 5 bedroom dwelling for example. Its the same with Classes in their simplest form, you could define a Class representing a 3 bedroom dwelling, and another Class that represents a 5 bedroom dwelling.\n",

You could use a blueprint of a 3 bedroom home to build multiple 3 bedroom homes - 1 blueprint to create multiple 3 bedroom homes. This is what happens with a Class. You can create multiple Objects from your single Class - remember, a Class is just the blueprint for creating Objects of the same type.\n",
